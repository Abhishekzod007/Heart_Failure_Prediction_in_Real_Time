# 💓 Real-Time Heart Failure Prediction and Alert System

A **real-time, distributed heart failure prediction pipeline** built using **Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, and XGBoost**, capable of processing live patient vitals and triggering proactive alerts for high-risk cases.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on developing a Real-Time  Heart Failure Prediction and Alert System using cutting-edge technologies such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, and XGBoost. The system is designed to process continuous streams of patient heart data from multiple sources, apply machine learning algorithms for early detection of potential heart failure, and provide immediate alerts for healthcare providers.

The pipeline is built on an Ubuntu VMware environment, ensuring a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture. Kafka producers simulate real-time data streams in JSON format, while Spark consumers process the incoming data efficiently. The XGBoost model is integrated into the pipeline to perform predictions based on both the CVD and UCI datasets, ensuring reliable risk assessments. The solution also emphasizes data consistency, integrity, and scalability, making it suitable for real-time medical monitoring systems.

## ✅ Problem Statement

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death globally, where early detection and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. However, continuous monitoring of heart health in real-time is challenging due to several factors:

1. High volume and velocity of data generated by medical devices and sensors.

2. Need for low-latency processing to ensure timely alerts and interventions.

3. Complexity of predicting heart failure using clinical and physiological data that may be noisy or incomplete.

4. Existing systems often rely on manual data entry or offline analysis, causing delays in treatment.

5. Maintaining data integrity and user identification during real-time processing is difficult in distributed environments.

6. These challenges call for an automated, real-time system capable of handling large data streams and providing actionable predictions with minimal delay.

## ✅ Solution

To address these challenges, we built a comprehensive system that:

1. Ingests real-time patient data using Kafka producers that send heart-related vitals in structured JSON format to specific Kafka topics.

2. Processes streaming data using Apache Spark Streaming, ensuring low-latency handling and fault-tolerant computation.

3. Applies machine learning models (XGBoost in this case) trained on datasets such as CVD and UCI, which include critical health parameters relevant to heart failure.

4. Handles missing or incomplete data through preprocessing steps, improving model robustness and accuracy.

5. Maintains data integrity and user-specific tracking, ensuring predictions are accurate and personalized.

6. Provides real-time alerts for high-risk patients, allowing healthcare providers to act immediately.

7. Ensures scalability and resilience, leveraging distributed computing environments on Ubuntu VMware for seamless operation across multiple nodes.

The result is a powerful, scalable, and efficient real-time monitoring system capable of transforming heart health diagnostics, minimizing risks, and enabling proactive medical care.
